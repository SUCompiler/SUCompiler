    To extract the code for Chapter 12, for example, enter the command
    
    	jar -xvf Chapter12.jar
    to create the directory Chapter12 containing the Java source tree.

Compile

    To compile the Java code for Chapter 12, for example, enter the commands:
    
    	cd Chapter12
    	mkdir classes
    	javac -classpath classes -d classes -sourcepath src src/*.java
    Of course, a much better way to work with the Java source tree is to load it into a development environment such as the Eclipse IDE for Java developers.

Run

    After compiling the Java code for Chapter 12, for example, the following command (entered while in directory Chapter12) will interpret the Pascal program hilbert.pas (enter 5 when it prompts for the rank):
    
    	java -classpath classes Pascal execute hilbert.pas
    To view the cross-reference table and the intermediate code (parse trees), include the -x and -i options, respectively. You can combine the options as -ix:
    
    	java -classpath classes Pascal execute -ix hilbert.pas
    The book describes each of the options i, x, l, a, f, c, and r.
